# Violent crimes occur more frequently in city centers and during evening hours in San Francisco and Seattle, U.S.A.
## Executive Abstract:
Both San Francisco and Seattle are cities which are rapidly being gentrified causing a change in the social and economic structures of the cities. Therefore, it is likely that crime is also driven by these mechanisms with a clear distinction of which crimes occur in which parts of these cities and during what times of the day. Areas already gentrified are more likely to be affected by property crimes than violent ones.
